Read the MDN Web Docs on querySelectorAll() and the MDN Web Docs on setAttribute()

The Document method querySelectorAll() returns a static (not live) NodeList representing a list of the document's elements that match the specified group of selectors. Here is the link to the documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll

The Element.setAttribute() function sets the value of an attribute on the specified element. If the attribute already exists, the value is updated; otherwise, a new attribute is added with the specified name and value. Here is the link to the documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute

Conditional (ternary) operator - JavaScript | MDN
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands:
